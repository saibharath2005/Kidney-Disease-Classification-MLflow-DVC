                <h2>What is Kidney Disease?</h2>
                <p>
                    Kidney disease refers to conditions that impair the kidneys' ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. 
                    Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can lead to kidney failure if not detected early.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common causes include diabetes, high blood pressure, and genetic disorders. 
                    Early detection is crucial to prevent progression to kidney failure.

                <h2>Technology Used: VGG16 CNN Model</h2>
                <p>
                    This project leverages the <strong>VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> for kidney disease classification. 
                    VGG16 is a 16-layer deep CNN, widely recognized for its strong feature extraction capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We apply <strong>transfer learning</strong> on the pre-trained VGG16 model, fine-tuning it on kidney scan images 
                    to accurately classify them as healthy or diseased. This allows high performance even with a limited dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend is implemented using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong>, while 
                    <strong>DVC (Data Version Control)</strong> manages datasets and ML pipelines to ensure reproducibility 
                    and versioning of experiments.

                <h2>Impact on Healthcare</h2>
                <p>
                    By utilizing the VGG16 CNN model, this system can predict kidney disease rapidly and accurately from scan images. 
                    It supports doctors in early diagnosis, reducing errors and improving patient outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI-based kidney disease classification improves early detection, aids clinical decision-making, 
                    and demonstrates the transformative potential of deep learning in healthcare.
